# Supported Models

vllm-metal currently focuses on text-only language models on Apple Silicon. Multi-modal (vision / audio input) models are not yet supported.

## Text-Only Language Models

`Automatic Prefix Cache` describes the default behavior when the user does
not pass `--enable-prefix-caching`. After
[#283](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/pull/283), unified paged-KV
models on Metal can reuse shared prefixes by default. Upstream vLLM still
keeps the default off for hybrid/Mamba models, so those rows remain `❌`
unless prefix caching is explicitly forced. These values describe the
default engine behavior, not exhaustive model-by-model benchmarking on
Metal. Qwen3 is explicitly covered by the paged prefix-cache e2e test.
